    Lowered drop rate estimation for Magnataur Hunting Horn
    
    It's clearly much more rare than originally thought. The limited data I
    have now suggests a droprate between 2% and 5%, so ~3% seems to be a
    much more accurate estimation than the blanket 10% I picked for all RWL
    pets at first.
