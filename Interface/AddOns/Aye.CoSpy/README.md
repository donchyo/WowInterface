# Aye.CoSpy

**Aye.CoSpy** is a small addon, that helps in **Court of Start** dungeon's spy trash aka "clue" minigame.
**Aye.CoSpy** shows certain gear parts of Suspicious Nobles in handy GUI frames, so it's easier to judge if it's a demon, or not.

## Options
Aye.CoSpy provides no options at all. Just install and it's ready!

## Usage
Target **Suspicious Noble** in **The Jeweled Estate** (inside **Court of Stars**) to show handy GUI frames *(as shown above)*.
GUI frames will always open 200px right of the centre of screen, and will be available only while you target **Suspicious Noble**.

## Intergation
Aye.CoSpy reads clues from party, instance, and say chat.
Aye.CoSpy is also fully intergated with [DBM](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods) and [Angry Keystones](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/angry-keystones).

## Depot
This addon uses [Aye](https://github.com/Benio101/Aye) as depot.
