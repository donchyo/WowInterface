v3.38 [June 7th 2018]
This is probably the last release version before BfA hits.
Any further fixes will be only available via alpha build.

Fixes:
- Fixed some icons missing from minimap icons bar after v3.36
- Fixed (probably) a random armory error caused by invalid item data from artifact weapons
- Fixed tab fonts for inspect armory not applying on load
- Fixed garrison report button jumping around after loading screens
- Fixed deconstruct mode not working on lockpick with a colorblind mode in wow emabled
- Fixed broken custom textures for classbar when suddenly a new section is added
- Fixed an error in config when no gold data is available for some reason
- Fixed (probably) role icons in raid interface being broken
Additions:
- Added a no backdrop variant for location panel templates
- Added class option for armory background config
Changes:
- Updated LibRealmInfo
- Changed the way legacy modes work (e.g. farm and garrison toolbars). Can take longer to load buttons on some occasions.
- Adopted changes in ElvUI's chat from version 10.74
