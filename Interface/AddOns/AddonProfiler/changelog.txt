    - Fixed issues related to profiling with filters up
    - Fixed children not showing if their parent is filtered (Orphaning children is always a sad thing)

    - Fixed CPU to show in seconds instead of milliseconds, CPU/Sec still shows in milliseconds thought
    - Added text indicating CPU is shown in seconds, CPU/Sec in milliseconds

    * Changed garbage collection detection, now stops the GC during profile and manually runs a step and then restarts the GC once profiling is done. This should keep the GC numbers at least somewhat accurate without killing performance by having to check memory in a OnUpdate

    * Fixed sorting not working correctly when you had include modules enabled
    * Fixed sorting not using average CPU when scan finished
    * Fixed module detection, now attempts to use <parent>_<module> to find the owner first, then it falls back to check if it has only one dependency and associates it that way
    * Changed to formating to the second decimal place instead of the first for all stats
    * Changed to chat frame background as it's easier to read the text when the frame isn't 70% alpha

    * Added an addon filter so you can only profile an addon or two if wanted
    * After profiling finishes, CPU/Sec will turn into Avg/Sec and show the average CPU time in seconds over the profile time

    * Quick profiling addon that you can set to run for X amount of seconds, stats are reset at the start when it profiles, also attempts to keep track of how much garbage an addon creates. Includes support to group any "modules" into their parents, so if addon Apple has Orange as it's only dependency, then Orange will list its own stats combined with Apple's as well.

    * Quick profiling addon, lets you set a profile duration where it'll keep track of total CPU used over the passed period of time, as well as total amount of garbage created. Profiling stats are reset when you start a new profiler.
