# BigWigs_Countdown_Overwatch

**This addon is a BigWigs plugin and requires BigWigs to run.**

Adds countdown voices from the heroes in Overwatch to BigWigs.

Only the English locale is included. I do hope add other locales as soon as Overwatch's flavor of [CASC](https://wow.gamepedia.com/CASC) is figured out. Currently, there is no way to get the file layout (ie, file names) so it's all guess work.

The default countdown voice is set in Sounds in the BigWigs options (/bw). You can also enable countdown per ability and change the voice for it in that ability's Sounds tab.
